## Hello, I'm AstroÂ² (astrosquared)

I'm a student developer who loves Java and HTML/CSS/JS.

* I use Java frequently in backend projects (sometimes C# as well), usually to make things like discord bots and minecraft plugins/mods.
* I also love making websites, expecially with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript. I've also used Blazor WASM to make websites using C#.

### Projects

* BlazingGames (currently proprietary), a collaborative minecraft plugin adding reprogrammable javascript computers, an enchanting overhaul and many more features. I'm mostly working on computers, including a website to reprogram them.
* [Moosic](https://github.com/AstroSquared/moosic), a music bot for discord (it plays music on request in voice channels) with simple-to-use features using the new slash commands.
* [MCDiamondFire-Awesome](https://github.com/RedVortexDev/MCDiamondFire-Awesome), which I previously maintained, that contains a list of open-source projects that work with the the minecraft server DiamondFire.

Note: I do have quite a few projects that were never finished or are abandoned, so this isn't an accurate respresentation of all my work.
